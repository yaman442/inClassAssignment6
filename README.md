Q: Does other country sales correlate to Japan sales where the publisher was Nintendo? 

I wanted to find out if sales in other countries correlate to sales numbers from Japan when the publisher was Nintendo. I chose to compare Nintendo to the rest of the world (anything that's not NA, EU, or JP) because Nintendo is based in Japan and also because it seemed interesting, to me at least. Some things that I found from the charts were that there was a positive correlation and it was a moderate correlation at .53. I knew it was going to be positive because sales are always up and rarely down, but I wanted to know how strong the correlation was. When I saw the raw numbers I saw some games that were very popular in other countries that almost outsold Japan themselves. The scatterplot also show that there is a moderate positive correlation.
